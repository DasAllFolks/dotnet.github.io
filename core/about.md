## About .NET Core
.NET Core is part of ASP.NET 5 and is a subset of the .NET Framework. You can learn more about .NET Core and how and where you can use it in the [CoreCLR is open source](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/02/03/coreclr-is-now-open-source.aspx) blog post.

.NET Core consists of the runtime ([CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)) and the libraries ([CoreFX](https://github.com/dotnet/corefs)). Each of these is available on GitHub, either for raising issues or collaborating on development. The main goal is to create a streamlined, performant and cross-platform execution environment for modern applications.  

## Deeper overview
If all of the above is leaving you wanting more, you can always head over to our [deeper understanding](overview.html) write up that explains the entire stack, what are the moving pieces and so forth. The goal is simple, and that is to help you make sense of all the bits and pieces that you will need to interact with .NET Core, or simply to position it properly.
